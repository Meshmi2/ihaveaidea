Hello everyone,
I have a great idea,
as a new developer, I was able to learn about the possibilities offered by banners in my apps, I don't make much money and that's why, like everyone here, I'd like to earn something more ...
now I tell you my idea, the place here because it seems to me the most suitable place,
in practice I would like to create a platform, a site or an app, where every developer makes his advertising space available to promote the applications of all the developers registered in the project ...
my idea is to advertise the "developer1" app for free until "developer1" advertises my application always for free,
in this way the earnings will be for everyone, and after a cycle, all the registered developers will have more downloads more advertising space,
and the more you earn,
obviously for the first period of time everyone will promote "developer1" then in the second period of time, everyone (including "developer1") will promote the "developer2" app until it returns to advertise the "developer1" app but if everything works properly, with many more clicks and related earnings.
thank you all for reading ...
